# F1_DataVizProject
This project focuses on data collected from every Formula 1 racing season from 1950 and stays current with the 2018 season.

Our team plans to illustrate the major engineering advances in racing technology by highlighting the insane progression of the fastest sport on Earth. Fastest lap records, pit stop times, Constructor Cup standings, and even the race tracks themselves will be analyzed to reveal a deeper understanding of why racing fans worldwide remain loyal to their favorite racing teams in their favorite sport.
